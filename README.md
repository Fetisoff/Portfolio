Hi! This is portfolio of my projects shows different experience and skills, such a python, pandas, numpy, working with API, GIT and GITHUB etc.
 
To proof my experience with GIT, I have created this Repo and pushed all content from my local repo to GitHub using API and GIT.

At the August, 28 2017 this repo  contains 11 projects (they indexing starts from zero).
Each folder in repo  has the database I worked on this project with and Jupyter notebook, which contains some script and code manioulation with this database. 

At the moment, I am keep studying on Probability And Statistics, Machine Learning. Presume, new projects on these topics will be here by November.
